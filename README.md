# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Description ##
Twitter crawler that performs a sentiment analysis to determine whether tweets about something/someone are positive or negative. Project was done as a final project in a Python course at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU) in the fall of 2011.

## Requirements ##
The program uses the [data structure server Redis](http://redis.io/ "Redis Homepage"), to save the data collected. It therefore must be installed and running (by calling "redis-server") on the client's computer when using the program. 

The program also uses [Mako Templates](http://www.makotemplates.org/download.html "Mako Homepage") for Python to create a webpage with the results.
