This report describes in detail the design and implementation of the final project done for the course 02820 Python Programming.\\

There have been many projects that try to do sentiment analysis of text but, to the best of the author's knowledge, 
none have focused on football related comments and tweets from fans of the sport. It seemed ideal to the author to 
look at that area and see if he could create a program that can see if fans are speaking positively or negatively 
towards players, teams, managers, referees, something that happens in a game etc.\\

The main goal of the project was to a create a program that collects football related comments and tweets from Twitter,
perform a sentimental analysis of of each tweet collected and to show the results by creating a webpage. The program was
written with the Python programming language, uses the Twitter GET Search API to collect tweets, performs the analysis 
using Naive Bayes Classifier and displays the results in a simple html webpage.\\ 

An additional feature was to try to put collected data in a database. This is beneficial as the program can easily fetch
old data, for searches that have already been done before, and use it with the newly harvested tweets.\\

The work for this project was done between 29.August and 7.December in the fall semester of 2011.
